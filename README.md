## v3 - TODO

- [x] Teacher schedules - Need to merge from v3-abandoned into v3 
- [ ] Dark mode

- [ ] Better bug reports
- [ ] Fix UX on app update where screen flashes twice
- [ ] Fix dashboard layout UX (jumpy)
- [x] Update dependencies

- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Unit Tests

Stuff to remove:
- [ ] Moment.js (heavy dependency)
- [ ] Premature optimization
- [ ] Useless comments
- [ ] ESLint comments (actually stay consistent)
