# WHS

A schedule & mod information app for [WHS](http://whs.westside66.org/). Created
with [Expo](https://expo.io/)/[CRNA](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
& [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) by Andrew Li. This has
been ejected. Â© 2017 Andrew Li, MIT License.

Note: The school clock is roughly 18 - 22 seconds behind your phone time. The mod
timers have a roughly 20 second discrepancy.

# To Do List

This is the list of everything I want to get done in the app:

# Known Bugs

- The Bebas Neue Book font shows up a bit thicker on the app than anticipated
- The launch image on plus devices (i.e. iPhone 7 Plus) is stretched
- The drawer button on the Dashboard and Schedule screens requires two clicks
sometimes
- There's a weird space between the day counter sometimes
