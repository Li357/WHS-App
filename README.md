# WHS

A schedule & mod information app for [WHS](http://whs.westside66.org/). Created
with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) by Andrew Li. Â© 2018 Andrew Li, MIT License.

## v2.0.0

Complete rewrite and redesign with NativeBase. Getting rid of CodePush for app version uniformity.
Making the app less crappy and bug prone, with linting and unit testing (I hope). Less sloppy code.

## To Do List

This is the list of everything I want to get done in the app:

- [ ] v2.0.0 Rewrite
- [ ] Notification system for mod ends
